ensure the security and integrity of our IT systems. The respective
purposes of the processing also constitute our legitimate interests we
pursue with it (Art. 6 par. 1 lit. f) GDPR). We retain our log files for
14 days and delete them thereafter.</p>

platform. The legal basis for the processing described above is Art. 6
par. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
<h3 id="functions-of-the-platform">4. Functions of the Platform</h3>
<p>On our platform we provide you with the necessary tools to publish
content under cer-tain open access licenses. Some of these more open
licenses are free while for other more restricted licenses you have to
pay a fee (“pay to close”). We base any processing that is required to

ac-cording to our terms of services on Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
